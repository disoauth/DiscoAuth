Welcome to DisOAuth's documentation!
===================================


**DiscoAuth** (AKA Discord OAuth) is a python package to help create a oauth process for your Discord Application and/or your Discord Bot, using a *simple* api

To setup DisOAuth, you'll need to go to the :doc:`quickstart` page to get started, and see how to :ref:`install <installation>` it 

If you are here just to check the api, visit the :doc:`api` page.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.
